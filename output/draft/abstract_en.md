### Abstract

The Boseong Gwandong site, located in Boseong-gun, Jeollanam-do, is a large-scale settlement site where 155 dwelling structures from the Proto-Three Kingdoms Period (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE) to the Three Kingdoms Period (4th - 7th century CE) have been identified through systematic excavation. This study comprehensively analyzes the architectural characteristics, temporal changes, and regional features of these dwellings based on complete data from the Boseong Gwandong-Jangheung Sinwol Dwelling Site Status Table (2025.11).

### Key Findings

**1. Temporal Distribution**
- Proto-Three Kingdoms Period: 78 structures (50.3%)
- Three Kingdoms Period: 77 structures (49.7%)
- Total: 155 structures

**2. Architectural Features**
- Floor Plans: Gradual shift from circular/square (Proto-Three Kingdoms) to rectangular (Three Kingdoms Period)
- Four-Post Structures: 10 structures confirmed (6.5% of total), primarily from late Three Kingdoms Period
- Hearth Development: Evolution from simple hearths to sophisticated ㄱ-shaped and ㄷ-shaped forms

**3. Comparative Analysis**
- Analyzed 15 nearby sites (7 in Boseong, 8 in Jangheung)
- Cultural homogeneity confirmed in Eastern Honam region
- Gradual technological advancement verified

**4. Chronology**
- Radiocarbon dating results align with archaeological chronology
- Proto-Three Kingdoms: 1st century BCE - 3rd century CE
- Three Kingdoms Period: 4th - 7th century CE

### Significance

This study holds the following academic significance:

1. **Large-Scale Data**: Statistical reliability through complete analysis of 155 dwelling structures
2. **Temporal Changes**: Concrete identification of dwelling culture transition from Proto-Three Kingdoms to Three Kingdoms Period
3. **Regional Research**: Provision of fundamental data for Eastern Honam region archaeological research
4. **Methodological Significance**: Integration of radiocarbon dating with archaeological analysis

### Conclusion

The Boseong Gwandong site demonstrates a clear transition process from the simple dwelling structures of the Proto-Three Kingdoms Period to the formalized, enlarged, and sophisticated structures of the Three Kingdoms Period. The analysis of four-post structures and hearth development reveals gradual advancement in architectural technology. This data is expected to serve as important material for future research on Proto-Three Kingdoms and Three Kingdoms Period dwelling culture, settlement structure analysis, and inter-regional comparative studies in the Honam region.
