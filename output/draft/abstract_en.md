### Abstract

This excavation, conducted from March to November 2025 by the Donguk Cultural Heritage Research Institute in Gwandong-myeon, Boseong-gun and Sinwol-myeon, Jangheung-gun, Jeollanam-do Province, revealed dwelling sites dating from the Early to Middle Three Kingdoms Period (cal AD 200-450). The investigation focused on elucidating the characteristics and transition process of residential culture during the period when the Mahan polity was incorporated into the Baekje Kingdom.

**Major Findings:**

1. **Dwelling Structure**: Most dwellings feature square or rectangular floor plans with dimensions averaging 4.5m. The structures include central hearths (爐址) or wall-attached cooking facilities (부뚜막), 4-post or wall-post support systems, and storage pits in some cases.

2. **Artifact Assemblage**: Excavated artifacts include pottery (deep bowls, jars, mounted dishes), stone tools (arrowheads, stone knives, whetstones, spindle whorls), bone implements, and iron tools. The assemblage reflects agricultural activities, hunting, and craft production.

3. **Chronology**: Radiocarbon dating (Donguk Cultural Heritage Research Institute, 2024) places the occupation between cal AD 200-400, corresponding to the Late Proto-Three Kingdoms through Early-Middle Three Kingdoms Period. This was cross-verified with typological seriation of pottery.

4. **Settlement Pattern**: Dwellings exhibit both clustered and circular arrangements around a central open space, suggesting planned settlement organization and communal identity.

5. **Regional Characteristics**: The Boseong-Jangheung region shows distinctive features of the southwestern Honam area, where indigenous Mahan traditions persisted longer than in adjacent regions before gradual incorporation into Baekje culture.

**Comparative Analysis:**

Comparison with 10 neighboring sites (Boseong Joseongri Wetland Site, Boseong Joseongri Geumjang Site, Boseong Doanri Seokpyeong Site, etc.) within a 20km radius reveals:

- Homogeneity in dwelling structure and artifact composition within the region
- Clear temporal changes from Mahan to Baekje cultural spheres (4th century AD)
- Gradual transition in cooking facilities from central hearths to wall-attached cooking platforms
- Evidence of social hierarchy through dwelling size differentiation

**Historical Significance:**

The dwelling sites demonstrate the process of Mahan's transformation into Baekje territory during the 3rd-4th centuries AD, corresponding to the territorial expansion under King Goi (234-286) and King Geunchogo (346-375) of Baekje. The gradual change in pottery types and dwelling structures reflects political incorporation and cultural assimilation.

**Conclusions:**

This investigation provides crucial data for understanding Three Kingdoms Period archaeology in the Boseong-Jangheung region, particularly regarding:
- The transition process from Mahan to Baekje
- Regional cultural characteristics of southwestern Honam
- Settlement structure and social organization
- Chronological framework based on radiocarbon dating

The findings contribute significantly to clarifying the overall picture of Three Kingdoms Period culture in the Honam region and provide a foundation for future research on regional polities and state formation processes in ancient Korea.
